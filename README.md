# React recruitment template

The `react-recruitment-template` used for React live coding tasks.

Main points:

-   Set up with recommended `VSCode` extensions, `EditorConfig`, `ESLint` and `Prettier` for better developer experience
-   Uses `Husky` for automatic project linting with Git hooks
-   Uses strict `TypeScript` and `Zod` to ensure good type safety
-   Uses CSS-in-JS with `styled-components`
-   Uses `react-query` for BE communication
-   Uses `Vite` bundler
-   Uses `Vitest` for unit and integration tests

See `package.json` for specific packages. Check `.nvmrc` for NodeJS version with `nvm`.
